> [!info] General Information
> Acronia is the city where Mitranians reside, no other race aside from the Human Slaves are allowed within its walls due to the Tyranical Laws of the city.
> 
> Speaking of, it is governed by a totalitarian council composed of 12 elder members that somehow have lived for way longer than they should've. While Acronia is the only Mitranian city that the Council truly governs, other smaller Mitranian villages are under Acronian influence.
> 
> The city is the house of many technological advancements, such as making large landmasses float which allows for more residential space. While the parts near the walls have a more Medieval feeling, the city's center is a bit more modern and houses most of the commercial areas.
