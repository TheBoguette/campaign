# Additional Information

> [!religion] The Old Cathedral
> Not much is known about this structure but all that has been recovered from it is a mural depicting the Sun Goddess and the Moon God in a disagreement, with that we can determine that the Humans that inhabited this city worshipped one or the other.
> ^Cat
> > [!note] Note
> > Since the Acronia Mitranians utterly destroyed the city and it's culture the little we know about it is only speculation. Not much Humans that had lived there survived.

> [!councilhouse] The Ruined Colosseum
> The Ruined Colosseum is the remains of a Human megastructure. It was apparently used for entertainments and fights but the information we can get on it is very scarce.
