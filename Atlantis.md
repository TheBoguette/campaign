> [!info] General Information
> Atlantis is an underwater city where most Halosdyneans reside, unlike Acronia, all races are allowed in but not many of them visit the city as the availability of items granting waterbreathing are poor and acquiring this ability is very hard.
> 
> The city is governed by multiple clan ambassadors, all following the example of the long gone Halosdynean Empress and going by the laws of The Heiress.
> 
> It is known for its beautiful architecture and large crystal mines which help it monopolize the Artificial Magic industry.
